# NLP-Tasks-Data-Analytics
This project demonstrates how to perform various NLP tasks such as sentence tokenization, word tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, stopping words removal, dependency parsing, perceptron, named entity recognition (NER), and chunking using popular NLP libraries such as spaCy and NLTK in Python.
To perform sentence tokenization, the sent_tokenize() function from the NLTK library is used, which can tokenize the given text into individual sentences.

For word tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and stopping words removal, we can use the nltk library's various functions such as word_tokenize(), PorterStemmer(), WordNetLemmatizer(), and stopwords.words() respectively.

For dependency parsing, we can use spaCy's displacy module to visualize the dependency relationships between different words in the sentence.

For perceptron, we can use the PerceptronTagger class from NLTK's perceptron module to tag parts of speech in the given text.

For NER and chunking, we can use spaCy's built-in named entity recognizer and chunker, which can identify and extract entities and noun phrases from the text.

Overall, this project provides a basic understanding of how to perform various NLP tasks using Python's popular NLP libraries, which can be further extended and customized as per specific use cases.
